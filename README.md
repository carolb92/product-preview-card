### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was a good opportunity to practice Flexbox. I initially had trouble with the product image figure and the adjacent text div remaining the same height in response to a change in browser size/width (in the desktop design).  I was ultimately able to achieve this using the ```align-items: stretch;``` property in Flexbox, which I often forget is an option.


### Continued development

After completing the project, I realized this design would have lent itself well to a CSS grid layout, which I will continue to work on.
